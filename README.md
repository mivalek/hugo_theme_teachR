# theme `teachR` for HUGO

Minimal example of a university module website with multiple page types (slides, "sheets") made with `R blogdown`.

Documents are rendered with tweaked versions of `xaringan` slides and `distill` pages available in `mivalek/teachR`. 
Until multiple output feature is accepted into official `blogdown`, `mivalek/blogdown` is required.
